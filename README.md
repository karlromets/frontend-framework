## Architecture

<!-- - **`dot.js` (Main Entry Point):** The framework's public API. This is where you'll find the main functions for using DotJS, like mounting your application.
- **`dom.js` (DOM & Component Engine):** Handles everything related to the DOM. It creates JavaScript versions of HTML elements, renders them to the browser, and manages components, attributes, styles, and event listeners.
- **`state.js` (State Management):** Provides tools for managing state, both for the entire application and for individual components. It also handles UI updates when state changes.
- **`router.js` (Routing):** Manages browser history and URL changes, allowing you to create different "pages" in your single-page app.
- **`http.js` (HTTP Client):** A helper for making HTTP requests to fetch or send data. -->

## Design Principles

DotJS is guided by these core ideas:

1.  **Simplicity:** A minimal and intuitive API. We favor clarity over feature bloat.
2.  **Developer Control:** Understandable and predictable behavior. No hidden magic, what you see is what you get.
3.  **Vanilla First:** Built on standard browser APIs, avoiding external framework dependencies.
4.  **Inversion of Control:** As a framework, DotJS calls your code (like component functions) to construct the application.
5.  **Progressive Enhancement:** Start with the basics and build up complexity as needed.
