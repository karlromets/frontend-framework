# Code of Conduct for DotJS Framework

![framework-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/framework-code-blueviolet)

## Purpose
The DotJS frontend framework is a learning project created to understand how frontend frameworks operate by building one from scratch. 
**This framework is not intended for production use**. Its **primary goal** was to gain an educational experience, helping us to gain insights into the mechanics of frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, thereby understand their ability to work with these tools in real-world development processes.

## Our Pledge

We, the **_Blind Dating App Team_** of DotJS, were committed to fulfilling our curiosity for learning by bringing this custom frontend framework to life. Our aim was to deepen our understanding of how frontend frameworks function, making it easier to adopt and utilize frameworks in future projects.


## Our Responsibilities

Our responsibilities align with the core objectives of the project, as outlined in the task requirements:

- **Framework Development**: We have implemented a frontend framework from scratch, without relying on existing frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte). DotJS includes essential features such as:
    - **State Management**
    - **Routing**
    - **Event Handling**
    - **DOM Manipulation**
    - **HTTP Requests**
    - **Performance Optimization**

- **Example Application**: We have provided a fully functional Todo application in the `example` directory, demonstrating developed features. The example is extensible, allowing reviewers to add functionality to validate its capabilities.

- **Documentation**: The `framework` directory includes a `README.md` file and additional Markdown documentation covering all the features

  >The documentation is clear, understandable.
